        <h3>Hello World!</h3>
        <p>
          I feel suited for web developement with my media experience in
          problem-solving and creative thinking with my technical skills.
          Through SheCodes Bootcamp, I‚Äôve showcased the ability to learn quickly
          and apply skills to real-world projects. I enjoy creating
          user-focused, innovative websites and have a strong foundation in
          HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, APIs, and design principles. I am eager
          to expand my expertise further, particularly by strengthening my
          efficiency in JavaScript, gaining proficiency in TypeScript, and
          exploring DevOps practices. My goal is to continue growing as a web
          developer, becoming confident in my coding ability and being
          career-ready.
        </p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I‚Äôm based in London and recently wrapped up a contract with Apple
          Corps, working on The Beatles: Anthology documentary series for
          Disney+. From this, I‚Äôve developed transferable skills like working
          under pressure, attention to detail, and collaboration. I also
          consider myself <strong>organised</strong> - meticulously organising
          archive footage, creating a data logging process in Excel, track
          progress and correcting transcript errors. Able to handle my job and
          multiple workload alongside learning a new skill.
          <strong>Compassionate</strong> - helped set up the first CAMHS support
          group for girls recently diagnosed with autism, met their needs and
          provided mentoring in a confidential environment.
          <strong>Inquisitive</strong> - taken the initiative to seek out
          courses and workshops code and gain knowledge in various software and
          frameworks. Utilising my creativity into personal projects to
          demonstrate my coding skills and technical capability.

        <h2>Autism/ADHD</h2>
        <p>
          As someone who is AuADHD, coding and programming roles appeal to me as
          it values creativity, attention to detail and I find the logical and
          rule-based nature of programming languages to be both intriguing and a
          satisfying process.
